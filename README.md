# ArcPay

ArcPay is a payment system designed to exceed Visa level scale, while giving rollup style safety guarantees.

ArcPay is a [validium](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/validium/), so transactions cost no gas, and only impose a small prover cost, and there is no limit transaction limit per block. Unlike prior validiums, ArcPay users can trustlessly recover their funds without relying on any external party such as a data availability committee.
